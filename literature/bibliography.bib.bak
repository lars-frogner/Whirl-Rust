  abstract = {{A new hydrodynamic code applicable to a space of an arbitrary number of dimensions is discussed and applied to a variety of polytropic stellar models. The principal feature of the method is the use of statistical techniques to recover analytical expressions for the physical variables from a known distribution of fluid elements. The equations of motion take the form of Newtonian equations for particles. Starting with a non-axisymmetric distribution of approximately 80 particles in three dimensions, the method is found to reproduce the structure of uniformly rotating and magnetic polytropes to within a few per cent. The method may be easily extended to deal with more complicated physical models.}},

  abstract = {{We determine a new resolution requirement for the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) numerical method when self-gravity is included. Comparison calculations between an SPH code and an Eulerian grid code are performed. The calculations are of a computationally demanding molecular cloud collapse and fragmentation problem. We demonstrate that the results given by the two different hydrodynamic methods are in good agreement, so long as the minimum resolvable mass in the SPH calculations is always less than the Jeans mass. If this criterion is not satisfied, SPH may give incorrect results, with the stability of near-Jeans-mass clumps depending on the details of how the SPH code is implemented rather than on physical processes. We give examples, from the literature, of problems that have been encountered in simulations of star, galaxy and cosmological-structure formation where this resolution requirement is ignored.}},

  abstract = {This paper presents an overview and introduction to smoothed particle hydrodynamics and magnetohydrodynamics in theory and in practice. Firstly, we give a basic grounding in the fundamentals of SPH, showing how the equations of motion and energy can be self-consistently derived from the density estimate. We then show how to interpret these equations using the basic SPH interpolation formulae and highlight the subtle difference in approach between SPH and other particle methods. In doing so, we also critique several ‘urban myths’ regarding SPH, in particular the idea that one can simply increase the ‘neighbour number’ more slowly than the total number of particles in order to obtain convergence. We also discuss the origin of numerical instabilities such as the pairing and tensile instabilities. Finally, we give practical advice on how to resolve three of the main issues with SPMHD: removing the tensile instability, formulating dissipative terms for MHD shocks and enforcing the divergence constraint on the particles, and we give the current status of developments in this area. Accompanying the paper is the first public release of the ndspmhd SPH code, a 1, 2 and 3 dimensional code designed as a testbed for SPH/SPMHD algorithms that can be used to test many of the ideas and used to run all of the numerical examples contained in the paper.},

  abstract = { This review discusses smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) in the astrophysical context, with a focus on inviscid gas dynamics. The particle-based SPH technique allows an intuitive and simple formulation of hydrodynamics that has excellent conservation properties and can be coupled to self-gravity with high accuracy. The Lagrangian character of SPH allows it to automatically adjust its resolution to the clumping of matter, a property that makes the scheme ideal for many application areas in astrophysics, where often a large dynamic range in density is encountered. We discuss the derivation of the basic SPH equations in their modern formulation, and give an overview about extensions of SPH developed to treat physics such as radiative transfer, thermal conduction, relativistic dynamics, or magnetic fields. We also briefly describe some of the most important applications areas of SPH in astrophysical research. Finally, we provide a critical discussion of the accuracy of SPH for different hydrodynamical problems, including measurements of its convergence rate for important classes of problems. },
